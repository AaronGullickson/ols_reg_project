# OLS Regression Project for Sociology 512

For this project, you will use Add Health data to analyze the relationship between a student's academic achievement and the number of friend nominations they received (i.e. popularity). The Add Health data in RData format and a README describing the data are both available in the `input` directory of this repository. Academic achievement can be operationalized by both the pseudo-GPA and honor society variables in the dataset and you will also need to consider the effects of other potential confounding variables in the dataset. You should use this data to analyze the relationship between academic achievement and popularity while taking account of all the issues we have discussed in the module on OLS regression issue, including:

- missing values
- collinearity 
- heteroscedasticity 
- design effects
- model selection

You should write a report in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) detailing how you addressed these various concerns and developed the models that you ultimately selected. You should also discuss how to interpret the final models. A template `ols_reg_project.Rmd` has been provided to help get you started.

To complete the assignment, push all of your analysis to the GitHub repository and upload a PDF version of the report to the Canvas assignment page.
